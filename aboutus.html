          <h3>Our Students:</h3>
          <p>
            Observing the different walks of the human life, we see only those names at the height of fame who have decorated fully themselves with knowledge. It is a fact that these are the students who are a capital, asset and safe guarantee of a country. The forthcoming development of a country is also dependent upon these capable and confident personalities. The period of education is the time of mental stability for students. This time during which they observe the facts of life with a vision must be peaceful. Students must abstain from fruitless activities involving which they lag behind the purpose of education. Learners should adopt the untiring efforts for better development of mental abilities during the education and think positively living away from negative approach.
          </p>
          <a name="h3"></a>
          <h3>Ability Based Selection of Subjects:</h3>
          <p>
            It is crystal clear that persons with diverse abilities are needed to prop up the building, development and progress in the various circles of national life. Students should select their subjects according to their God gifted abilities so that motherland may be provided with the variety of citizens. Endless efforts are made in helping learners to select suitable subjects according to their abilities.
          </p>
          <a name="h4"></a>
          <h3>Actions in Reconciliation with National Demand:</h3>
          <p>
            We need such people for building the nation who can be Boo Ali Seena in knowledge, can borrow their wisdom from Iqbal, reform the society like Shah Wali Ullah and Ismail Shaheed, can be Saadi & Haali in the field of poetry. But it is necessary for the students of the nation to show their dutifulness besides right training according to their natural abilities. Students hence will be fully guided how to meet national requirements.
          </p>
          <a name="h5"></a>
          <h3>Adopting Islamic Character:</h3>
          <p>
            Pakistani students should be aware of this historical fact that we got this piece of land in the name of Islam. Our all material developments would be openly a source of loss to us if we could not develop Islamic culture here. If the students would swim in the river of Secularism forgetting their Islamic customs and lost our national identity, it will surely be a suicide.
          </p>
          <a name="h6"></a>
          <h3>Love with Learning:</h3>
          <p>
            Intellectual abilities of the students are a sacred liability of the nation. And this liability can only be paid when students engage themselves with attaining knowledge wholeheartedly during period of their schooling. On quitting school they should use their intellectual abilities for the benefit of the nation. If the brave people among our ancestors who attained the education had no stability and courage, Islam would not have got muhaddis like Imam Bukhari and philosophers like Hakeem Abu Nasar Faraabi. Maulana Azad, Khawaja Haali, Maulvi Nazir Ahmed, Allama Shibli Noumani, Allama Iqbal and certain other ancestors acquired education after facing many hardships.
          </p>
          <a name="h7"></a>
          <h3>Defense of the Country:</h3>
          <p>
            Competing the offensive intentions of the global hostilities, there is only one option left with us to implement the compulsory army training system in our country under which our youth may be trained in martial activities along with formal education to defend the country.
          </p>
          <a name="h8"></a>
          <h3>High Aims:</h3>
          <p>
            The most important duty of a student is to determine his goal. It is necessary to work courageously to reach the destination successfully. One of the scholars say “in order to get success one should know first that he has been created for which profession and then he should work hard for it without any break”. Only those people get success in the world who work continuously. That person is better who has only one ability but knows how to obtain the purpose than that who has diverse abilities but fails to know which of those he can use successfully.
          </p>
          <a name="h9"></a>
          <h3>Conversation Skills:</h3>
          <p>
            A student should be well versed in the conversation skills. Conversation etiquettes have a distinguished place in the social relations. If a person can give suitable words to his conversation, he is thought to be a polite one. Conversation is actually a mirror to the speaker. We usually get an idea about the mental approach of a person from his words. Conversation plays a great role in the success of a person.
          </p>
          <a name="h10"></a>
          <h3>Public Service:</h3>
          <p>
            Good are the people whose life and death is for others, who work for the benefits of other people irrespective of their own gains. Real human being is that who work for others in this life. If a heart has no public service thought, that heart is a piece of stone. In our history Tipu Sultan, Allama Iqbal and Muhammad Ali Jinnah spent each of their seconds in the service of humanity.

          <p class="hidden">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
